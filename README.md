# Responsive-Portfolio
This was a lot of fun to do, I haven't ever really touched Bootstrap before. I had a little bit of a hiccup with my power being cut from 1:20pm-4:22pm 07/29/2020 but nonetheless I did the best I could and gave it my all. I honestly want to reign in my handling with Bootstrap, I am so used to doing my own HTML/CSS and code for everything that I wish I kind of knew about this method of coding before. Very convenient and fast. Almost as if using Wix or some other website builder in a sense.

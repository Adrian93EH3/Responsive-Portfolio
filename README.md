# Responsive-Portfolio
I feel as though I'm getting the hang of this Bootstrap framework and figuring out the spacing.

# Project Details
This project will have a Home page, Portfolio Page and Contact Page.

# Home Page
On this page you will see a picture of me along with a bio and a button linking to my portfolio.
